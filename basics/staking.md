# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of OtterClam.** Stakers stake their **CLAM** tokens on [the OtterClam website](https://app.otterclam.finance/#/stake) to earn harvest rewards. The harvest rewards come from the proceed from [bond sales](https://docs.otterclam.finance/basics/bonding) and can vary based on the number of **CLAM** tokens staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of **CLAM** translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of CLAM drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked CLAM balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock CLAM and receive an equal amount of sCLAM.** Your sCLAM balance harvests up automatically at the end of every epoch. sCLAM is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sCLAM and receive an equal amount of CLAM.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming harvest reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked CLAM (if any) will continue to receive harvest rewards.
