# What is (1,1) Bonding

#### Note: If you are unsure of what "1,1" "3,3" and "4,4" mean, check our [game-theory-x-x.md](../game-theory-x-x.md "mention")

### 1,1 Bonding

* 1,1 Bonding is the process of buying regular 1,1 Bonds
* Users can swap selected tokens (usually stable coins like DAI and USDC) or LP pairs (Clam-MAI or Clam-Frax) directly with the Protocol in exchange for discounted Clam tokens.
* This allows the Protocol to build reserves of stablecoins which help grow the project and allow us to offer attractive APYs.
* In return, Bonders will receive a linearly vested supply of discounted Clam tokens which can be redeemed and staked or traded.

> Note : You **DO NOT** get the LP or Stable coins after 5 days
