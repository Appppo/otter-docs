### 4,4 Bonding

4,4 Bonding is very similar to (1,1) bonding with some differences

* The rewards for a 4,4 bonds are paid in sClam(staked Clam) instead of Clam
* Complete Value of 4,4 bond is staked, not separated into epochs
* Your rewards compound as they are vested, meaning you don't have to stake them, after claiming them
* Bonds have a vesting period of 5 days and you can claim at the end.
*   The percentage shown in sidebar is ROI (Return of Investment) after 5 days and not discount.

    * Breakdown of percentage is show on the [bonds](https://app.otterclam.finance/#/bonds) page
    * In below example ROI is 12.28 = 0.70% (discount) + 11.58% (Rebase rewards on complete amount)

> Note: As you get sClam, you get rebase rewards even if you don't claim them.

> Claiming just moves sCalm from contract to your total staked amount.
