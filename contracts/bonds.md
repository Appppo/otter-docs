# Bonds

## MAI Bond

All bond contracts are more or less the same, with the one exception of the
assets or LP tokens they manage. The bond contracts handle all deposits and
redemptions. Here parameters for monetary policy are configured. Such parameters
are for instance the
[BCV](https://docs.otterclam.finance/references/glossary#bcv) and the max
individual payout. Below are listed MAI bond contracts by version, where the
latest version represents the currently active contract.
